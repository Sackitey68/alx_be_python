Your task is to complete a Python script that calculates the simple interest earned on an investment over a period of time. The formula for simple interest is (I = P * R * T), where:

( I ) is the interest earned,
( P ) is the principal amount (initial investment),
( R ) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
( T ) is the time the money is invested for in years.

P = 1000
R = 0.05
T = 3

I = (P * R * T)

print("The simple interest is:", I)
